Environmental reproducibility, achieved by fixing dependency versions and isolating the execution environment, provides "consistency guarantees" for each stage of the ML lifecycle: ensuring unbiased feature calculation logic during data preparation, preventing performance fluctuations due to dependency updates during model training, and eliminating runtime failures caused by environmental differences during deployment, directly supporting lifecycle reliability.
The key reproducibility principles applied in this project include: firstly, precise version locking (e.g., numpy==1.24.3) to prevent version drift; secondly, environment isolation (Poetry virtual environment + clean Ubuntu environment in CI) to avoid interference from system dependencies; and thirdly, automated verification, using smoke tests to confirm environment validity in real time.
Environment management and deployment success are strongly correlated: if dependencies are not fixed, a "valid model" in the development environment may fail due to different dependency versions in the production environment; while a reproducible environment can replicate the development configuration, reducing the probability of deployment failures.
